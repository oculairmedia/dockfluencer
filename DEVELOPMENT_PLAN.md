# Development Plan for Instabot Project

## 1. Development Environment Setup

### Local Development
- Set up Python environment with required dependencies
- Clone the repository locally
- Use local IDE for development and debugging

### Docker Development
- Use Docker for consistent development environment
- Dockerfile provided in the repository for building the application container
- docker-compose.yml available for orchestrating multiple services if needed

## 2. Version Control Workflow

- Use Git for version control
- Main branch: 'main' for stable releases
- Feature branches: Create for new features or bug fixes
- Pull Requests: Required for merging changes into 'main'

## 3. Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

### GitHub Actions
- Automatically triggered on push to 'main' and pull requests
- Builds Docker image
- Runs unit tests within Docker container
- (Future) Add linting and code style checks

### Local CI Testing
- Developers can test CI pipeline locally before pushing
- Build Docker image: `docker build -t instabot .`
- Run tests: `docker run instabot python -m unittest discover tests`

## 4. Testing Strategy

- Unit tests: Located in 'tests' directory
- Integration tests: (To be implemented)
- End-to-end tests: (To be implemented)

## 5. Deployment (Future Plan)

- Automated deployment to staging environment on successful CI build
- Manual approval for production deployment
- Use Docker for consistent deployment across environments

## 6. Monitoring and Logging (Future Plan)

- Implement application logging
- Set up monitoring for application health and performance
- Configure alerts for critical issues

## 7. Documentation

- Maintain up-to-date README.md with project overview and setup instructions
- Document API endpoints (if applicable)
- Keep this DEVELOPMENT_PLAN.md updated as the project evolves

## 8. Code Review Process

- All changes must be reviewed before merging into 'main'
- Use GitHub's pull request features for code reviews
- Enforce at least one approval before merging

## 9. Security Considerations

- Regular dependency updates
- Code scanning for vulnerabilities (to be implemented)
- Secure handling of sensitive information (use environment variables, never commit secrets)

This plan is subject to change and should be updated as the project evolves and new requirements emerge.
